# RockPaperScissors
This project will demonstrate my knowledge in Javascript.
Upon completion the main issue I faced was calling a function upon click and using that functions return value in another function. Doing this led to an 
undefined value read as the function tried to execute. I combined parts of the functions to initialize both calls; however, I initially wanted to avoid this as to make the initial functions more concise.
